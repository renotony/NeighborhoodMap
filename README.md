This file shows a list of schools in the Washoe County School District 
(which is where i live).  The list is filterable by school level 
(High School, Middle School, Elementary School) from a drop down 
and is also filterable by City (The cities in Washoe County School 
District that have schools) from a separate drop down.  Both filters 
are applied to the list in an "and" fashion.  The filters apply to 
the list as well as the markers that are shown on the map.

I wanted to use an API from localschooldirectory.com and provide the
enrollment and teacher count type data - but they wouldn't give me
an API key - so I settled on Wikipedia and providing a link to 
Wikipedia articles based on the school name.
